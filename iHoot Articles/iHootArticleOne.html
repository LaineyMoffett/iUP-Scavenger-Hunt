A lot of you might be thinking of going to college. Maybe even an Ivy. But how many of you are thinking of going to a Little Ivy like Vassar University? One of the 7 sisters?
<br>
<br>
<h3>What are the 7 sisters?</h3>
<br>
<br>
The 7 sisters are a group of colleges made in the late 19th century just for girls (it was like the girl Ivies). You might be thinking Vassar was made by a girl because it was an all-girls school, but it was not!! 
<br>
<br>
<h3>What?</h3>
<br>
<br>
Vassar was made by Matthew Vassar in 1861. A man. His niece Lydia Booth encouraged him to make a college for girls in Poughkeepsie New York. He built the school with $408,000 dollars (that would be 9.7 million dollars today's money).

<h3>Campus Tour</h3>
<br>
<br>
There are many attractions in and around the Vassar campus. One that has an iUP angle is the Juliet Billiard Cafe. It is 3 blocks away from the campus and a very popular spot for students, faculty, and locals. It was originally called the Vassar Grill and was owned, operated, and run by my great grandparents on my fatherâ€™s side of the family.

<h3>Connections</h3>
<br>
<br>                             
Vassar and iUP have some things in common. In addition to both being very good schools, they are both the first of sorts. Vassar was one of the first all-girls colleges.  And iUP was one of the first virtual schools in Texas. To round this all up I think one of the seven sisters would be good for us owls!
