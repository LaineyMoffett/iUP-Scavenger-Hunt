            The Answer to this question can vary from person to person but overall it is a good School that students that want to should definitely consider. Let's see what iUP students think!
             Makenna Horne says “Getting into an Ivy League school is so difficult and you have to stand out. I don't think that they give you credit for passing AP exams but they still expect you to take them and do well on them. Although it would be super cool to go to Harvard, it just seems out of reach and unattainable, so ultimately, I don't think I will be applying. ” I am inclined to agree that it is a very hard college to get into as you need to do well and pass on your AP  exams but they do not give credit for them as Makenna says. Alessandra Gonzalez says “It is a very expensive school, (though they do give scholarships out, I feel like depending on your financial situation and the amount of money offered towards your acceptance, it may or may not be enough to comfortably get you through the 4 years of college without drowning in debt). Other than money issues, I also just believe that it is an extremely competitive school that some students may thrive under but others may fall apart due to academic pressures. With these exceptions, It of course however lives up to its Ivy League reputation and is well-known for a good reason. Everyone has a different experience when attending a university. For some people, Harvard may be a perfect fit while for others it may not bring out the best in them. It all depends on where you are in your chapter of life :)”  this in my opinion is an amazing analysis of the financial aspect of college education, specifically that of Harvard.
